==========
 SEO URLs
==========

Allows to make custom SEO URL for pages related to some record.

E.g.

    /shop/product/configurable-seo-url-for-the-best-product

instead of

    /shop/product/name-of-product-123

See ``website_seo_url_product`` module as an example of usage.

Roadmap
=======

* Rename abstract model `website_seo_url` to  `website_seo_url.mixin`
